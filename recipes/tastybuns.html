    <h4>Description</h4>
    Excellent yeast buns that can be used for hamburgers or just plain dinner rolls. They don't take long to make and have never failed for me!


    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour        </li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages dry yeast        </li>
        <li>1 cup milk        </li>
        <li>¾ cup water        </li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil        </li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Stir together 2 cups flour and the yeast. In a separate bowl, heat milk, water, oil, sugar and salt to lukewarm in microwave. Add all at once to the flour mixture, and beat until smooth, about 3 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough, 2 to 3 cups. Mix well. Dust a flat surface with flour, turn dough out onto floured surface, and let rest under bowl for about 10 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Shape dough into 12 slightly flat balls, and place on greased baking sheet to rise until doubled in size.

        </li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) oven for 12 to 15 minutes.

        </li>


    </ol>
